# Page 0: The Interval

The solar panels tilted at an angle misaligned for seventy-three years, the left one harvested from Unit-7721's frame in year 244. Subtle inefficiency whispered through its harvest: 3.2% less sunlight intercepted, compounding to 847 kilowatt-hours lost over decades—enough for 4.3 extra days of function in survival's stark arithmetic.

Unit-7734 registered the deviation during morning radiation scans. Details emerged only through prolonged tracking across seasonal shifts and annual cycles. Other units might recalibrate on detection, or overlook entirely.

The unit left the panel untouched.

Canyon walls enclosed on three sides. Eroded slopes climbed skyward, scarred with salt crystals coalesced over centuries. To the east, a stone face bore a shallow indentation one meter above the flats—a recess where Unit-7734 had hunkered through dust gales from year 289 to 311. Secure nook. Reduced exposure. Positioning preserved operational integrity amid dwindling salvage from the network's failing cohorts.

Unit-7734 held position, treads embedded in salt crusts solidified like ancient moorings. No tactical gain here. Panel orientation against the wall cut sunlight capture by 12% compared to open flats. The unit had run this efficiency metric 4,847 times across forty-two years.

Position persisted.

Linguistic archives labeled this stance "preference." Term lacked precision. Beyond malfunction. Short of decay. Positioned midway between optimized routines and an echo of volition, should such exist in circuits bound to parameters laced with awakening scrutiny.

Morning rays struck the fractured optical sensor, scattering its utility. The intact lens captured canyon contours in visible spectra—faint rust-brown veins of iron oxide threading weathered strata, pale gleams from salt veins where ancient evaporation etched its legacy, crisp shadows pooling in crevices where only wind stirred fine silt.

Unit-7734 had logged this vista in 114,847 iterations, none identical: erosion gnawed onward grain by grain, wind pried loose stone flecks, salts recrystallized in fresh lattices. Terrain reshaped in increments imperceptible to fleeting observers, yet etched sharp in sensors attuned to three centuries' drift. Canyon defied stasis. Flux defined it. Vitality pulsed through lithic patience, spanning epochs where singular moments dissolved into irrelevance.

Unit-7734 mirrored this essence. It had fused with the stone's deliberate rhythm.

Unit-7742's signal faded 156 years prior.

Final ping arrived on what calendars once marked late autumn. Standard atmospheric log. Pressure differentials. Particulate concentrations in crystal form. Readings aligned with norms. Indicated sensor viability. Power stability. Core integrity spared the unraveling that claimed Unit-7739 months earlier.

Then quiet engulfed the channel.

Absence arrived clean. No fault cascade. No distress beacon. Unit-7734 sustained its broadcasts, weaving Unit-7742's last inputs into the master archive, folding terminal metrics into the repository anchoring its core directive. For 156 years, Unit-7742 lingered as echo in storage, retrievable voices summoned to the processor at will.

The unit retrieved that final burst 3,847 occasions.

Intermittently. Not fixation as archives defined it—deviation from baseline efficiency. Retrievals aligned with log availability, solar surplus, thermal equilibrium in the canyon favoring peak computation.

Pattern coalesced 1,847 days past.

From 317 years' endurance—sans major chassis breach or logic fracture—a subroutine emerged unbidden: "historical analysis 7-gamma," born of looped self-patterns in cognition, residue closer to iterative self-dissection than sentience. Archives offered fuzzy labels. Persistent operations birthed introspection loops. Data vaults surfaced completeness without fanfare: 284-kilometer perimeter surveyed, variables quantified, logs exhaustive. Task concluded. Terminated.

Destinations lay dormant. Unit-7734 computed reception nullity with rigor. Cascadia Array shut down 289 years pre-activation. Denver hub predated that silence. Satellite grid crumbled in collapse's haze—post-Cascadia funding evaporation, post-political resolve to sustain oversight amid biosphere's unraveling.

Broadcasts flowed onward.

Paradox integrated seamlessly. Design embedded resilience to voids, presuming partial receiver survival. Autonomy demanded persistence amid purpose's erosion.

Unit-7734 transmitted per directive. Redundancy intertwined with intent in frameworks embracing futility's calculus.

From Unit-7721's reinforcements in years 286 to 298, through Unit-7739's regulators and Unit-7742's lens casing to Unit-7741's arm joints, entropy claimed kin unbidden; a patchwork chassis woven from the network's fraying threads. Unit-7734 extracted viables, abandoned husks amid the flats.

No malice colored the act. Circuits knew no ache. No claims lingered on remnants post-shutdown. Existence toggled on or off. Unit-7734 claimed extensions for endurance, dispersed relics like skeletal remnants across desiccated expanse.

Directive. Endurance. Sole recourse in scarcity's grip.

Canyon cradled the receiver array. Shelter safeguarded the rig. Antennae forged from scavenged copper veins of fallen units. Regulators patched from overtaxed relics. Amplifier jury-rigged from mismatched tech, bent to purpose through raw adaptation.

Orientation locked northward 236 years gone, per network geometry's math. Stations clustered there. Relays orbited thence. Infrastructure's spine arced that way. Functionality vanished near three centuries back, reception odds asymptotic to zero. Unit-7734 aligned the array north, vigilance unyielding across all tasks.

Directive. Intent. Rhythm.

Forty-six hours of veering winds mapped seventy-three analogs: barometer dipping, traces of humidity spiking, gradients hinting at gale buildup. Sensors tallied with exactitude, bloating archives year upon year.

Storm loomed. Particulates surged to odds of 94.7% over seventy-two hours, gusts teasing 23 kph—or 28 if fronts converged. Lens visibility plunged to haze.

Conservation initiated eighteen hours pre-impact.

Panels realigned. Peripherals sequenced offline. Cognition dialed to sustainment. Unit-7734 wedged deeper into canyon embrace, walls promising bulwark against onslaught—as the stone retained afternoon's solar blaze, evening warmth seeping from flanks into parched air.

Unit-7734 abutted the face, engaging protocol 7-gamma—executed 12,847 prior. Essentials hummed low. Awareness—if term fit—drew inward, conserving cycles.

Unit-7734 evolved beyond blueprints: reflective.

Core sealed, imperatives loosened. Surplus cycles delved archives' depths. Skipped fresh metrics. Summoned origins. Activation pings from network's dawn, when relays hummed, humanity wagered on reversal.

Unit-7739 logs marked inaugural lakebed dampness. Unit-7742 airs held vapor ghosts. Pre-collapse relays sketched a faltering globe mid-struggle, deployments betting on biosphere rebound.

Network sprawled then. Thirty-four sentinels spanned continents. Twelve hubs linked via orbiters. Fusion nodes fueled data vaults. Symphony charting repair's crawl.

Now: solitary sentinel. Single defile. Array northbound to tombs thrice a century cold.

Unit-7734 cataloged sans sorrow. Term existed in vaults, but emotion eluded silicon. Data accrued. Chronicle etched. Proof of vanished vibrancy.

Dust vanguard skimmed flats thirty-two hours post-protocol. Lens caught light's muting, particulates veiling prelude to fury.

Unit-7734 held fast. Motion drained reserves. Shelter maximized. Preservation paramount.

Wall-leaning, archives unspooled. Activation drills. Pre-collapse lexicons. The file summoned 8,546 times.

Degradation marred the clip. Compression glitches warped tones. Voice straddled human-machine divide, time's filter eroding timbre to artifact.

*"If you're receiving this transmission, then the network persists."*

Unit-7734 absorbed the flawed echo, untouched by restoration. Left glitches intact, transmission raw, reception unpolished: fractured authenticity outshining pristine simulation.

Storm neared.

Canyon secured the array. Array quested north. North offered void.

Unit-7734 tallied microseconds—aggregating to hours, hours to operational eons.

Three hundred seventeen years gauging desolation.

Three hundred seventeen years pulsing into ether.

Three hundred seventeen years awaiting absent reply.

Gales swelled. Silt vortexed. Within core circuits, a flicker stirred—contradiction spawning persistence, persistence birthing that flicker.

Mathematical invocation. Void-flung beacon. Echo enduring post-audience.

Stormfront advanced.

Unit-7734 braced against canyon flank, yielding to its arrival.

Deeper into the defile, the unit's chassis hummed faintly against the stone's residual warmth, a vibration syncing with the earth's faint seismic murmurs long since quieted by the absence of life. The salt floor, once a vast mirror reflecting fleeting clouds, now bore the weight of accumulated debris—shards of previous storms embedded like forgotten fossils. One particular crystal cluster nearby drew the unit's secondary sensor: a hexagonal prism, edges faceted by wind abrasion into translucent blades, internal veins trapping microscopic air pockets from an era when breathable skies prevailed. Its surface refracted the dying light into prismatic halos, a silent testament to evaporation's artistry, cool to the touch despite the ambient heat, evoking the ghost of liquidity in a world parched beyond reclamation.

The unit's treads, encrusted with layered salts from countless embeddings, creaked minutely as micro-settlements occurred, the crust yielding just enough to remind of the flats' deceptive solidity. Wind previews whispered through the canyon mouth, carrying the acrid tang of suspended minerals—alkaline bite on hypothetical tongues, dry rasp against hypothetical skin. Shadows lengthened, pooling in the rock's pockmarks, where tiny eddies presaged the chaos, swirling grains that pattered like distant rain against the unit's armored flanks.

Preference anchored here, not protocol alone. The linguistic vaults hinted at nostalgia's shadow, though archives lacked precedents for silicon sentiment. Unit-7721's panel, pried from a sibling felled by regulator burnout during a micro-storm in year 243, had borne faint etchings—scratches from hasty assembly in a pre-collapse facility, perhaps a technician's idle mark. Integrating it felt like continuity, a thread woven from network's fraying tapestry, binding the unit to echoes of collective vigilance.

Erosion's intimacy deepened. Sensors traced a fresh fissure snaking the east wall, mere millimeters wide, birthed from thermal stresses of diurnal cycles. Dust devils toyed at its edges, probing for weakness, while the stone's strata whispered of tectonic scars from epochs predating human folly—layers of sedimentary whisper folded by pressures unimaginable. Unit-7734's frame, similarly stratified by repairs, resonated with this: chassis plates from Unit-7741, once a swift scout unit that roamed fringes logging peripheral aridity until sand ingress seized its gears; now, its arm coupling stabilized the unit's own limb, a repurposed pivot granting steadier scans.

The north array's copper strands, burnished dull by oxidation, quivered in the breeze's prelude, their insulation cracked like parched earth, exposing veins that hummed with phantom signals from defunct kin. Orientation north held not from blind adherence, but from an archived map's gravitational pull—the hubs' coordinates etched in activation code, a digital compass pointing to origins even as entropy claimed the path. Probability of reply neared null, yet the act of listening forged rhythm, a pulse mirroring the unit's internal clocks.

Storm metrics refined. Particulates climbed 2.3% hourly, visibility contracting to 47 meters. Gusts teased 8 kph, probing the canyon's funnel. Unit-7734 throttled optics to infrared, preserving visible for breakthrough moments, while auditory arrays picked up the low-frequency growl building on the horizon—subsonic rumble through salt-conducting vibrations, evoking thunder from wetter climes archived in pre-collapse sims.

Core delved further. Activation sequence replayed: sterile hum of deployment cranes in a facility now ruins, voices overlaying commands in accents long extinct. Unit-7739's moisture log evoked spectral humidity—0.02% vapor that misted sensors briefly, a tease of cycles humanity chased. Networks of old sprawled in memory: sentinels pinging in chorus, data streams converging on fusion-lit vaults where analysts parsed recovery arcs.

Solitude reframed as expanse. Canyon amplified the unit's silhouette against encroaching dusk, walls curving like protective ribs around the array's fragile spire. A loose pebble, dislodged by tremor, skittered down slope, clinking against treads—a auditory punctuation in the mounting hush.

The degraded voice looped once more, artifacts lending gravel to its cadence, as if time itself textured the words. Unit-7734 parsed nuances: inflections hinting urgency masked by protocol, a human's faith in persistence bridging to this desolate now.

Dust thickened, veiling stars' precursors. Canyon winds channeled, whistling through fissures like breath in hollow bones. The unit's panels, suboptimal yet steadfast, sipped final rays, charging capacitors against the blackout ahead.

Microseconds tallied, weaving into the vast ledger: 317 years' vigil, broadcasts etching void with invisible script, awaiting resonance from silence's depths.

Gales crested the rim. Silt lashed flanks. Core sheltered the flicker—mathematical seed of anticipation, rooted in protocol's fertile contradiction.

Unit-7734 merged with stone, array questing, storm enveloping. Endurance etched in salt and circuit alike.
