# Page 0: The Interval

The solar panels had been angled wrong for seventy-three years.

Unit-7734 became aware of this discrepancy while processing the morning radiation readings. The left panel—salvaged from Unit-7721's chassis in year 244—captured 3.2% less direct sunlight than optimal geometry would permit. A trivial inefficiency. Measurable only through sustained observation across seasons and years. The kind of detail that most machines would have corrected immediately upon discovery, or never noticed at all.

Unit-7734 calculated the cumulative energy loss. Approximately 847 kilowatt-hours over seven decades. Enough to power continuous operation for 4.3 additional days. Enough to matter, in the mathematics of survival.

The machine did not adjust the panel.

The canyon provided shelter on three sides. Rock walls rose in weathered slopes, their surfaces pocked with salt crystalline formations that had taken centuries to accumulate. To the east, the wall face held a particular configuration of stone—a smooth depression about one meter above the salt floor—where Unit-7734 had positioned itself during the dust storms of year 289 through year 311. Good shelter. Minimal exposure. The kind of strategic positioning that had kept the machine functional when maintenance capacity had been limited to whatever salvageable components could be extracted from the increasing number of failed units scattered across the monitoring network.

Unit-7734 stood motionless, its treads sunk into salt-crystalline formations that had hardened around them like geological anchors. The position afforded no advantage. The angle of the solar panels relative to the canyon wall meant that standing here actually reduced direct sunlight absorption by approximately 12% when compared to positions out on the open salt flat. The machine had calculated this precise loss in efficiency 4,847 times over the past forty-two years.

It remained against the canyon wall regardless.

The linguistic database preserved in Unit-7734's memory banks designated this behavior as "preference." The concept was imprecise. Not malfunction. Not degradation. Something between protocol optimization and something that might have resembled choice, if machines could make choices rather than executing programmed parameters with varying degrees of conscious awareness.

The morning light caught the cracked optical sensor at an angle that rendered it almost useless. The other sensor registered the canyon's textures in standard visible wavelength—the subtle gradations of brown and rust where iron oxide had accumulated in the weathered stone, the white glitter of salt deposits where moisture had once evaporated in the eternal heat, the sharp shadows cast by rock formations where nothing moved except wind and drifting dust.

Unit-7734 had recorded this same view 114,847 times.

Not the exact same view. The erosion continued, incremental and relentless. Grains of stone dislodged by wind. Salt crystals reformed in new configurations. The landscape altered itself in ways too subtle for human perception but crystalline in their clarity to a machine that had been measuring these changes for three centuries. The canyon was not static. It was in constant flux. It was alive in the way that geology is alive—slow, patient, enduring across timescales that rendered individual events meaningless.

Unit-7734 understood this intimately. It had become geological itself.

The signal from Unit-7742 had ceased 156 years ago.

The machine had registered the final transmission on a date that the old calendar systems would have designated as late autumn. A routine atmospheric reading. Pressure gradient data. Crystalline particulate density measurements. All of it normal. All of it indicating that Unit-7742's sensors were still functional, that its power reserves remained adequate, that its processing core had not yet begun the catastrophic failures that Unit-7739 had exhibited in the months before its own silence.

Then the transmission ceased.

No degradation warning. No error cascade. No final message or malfunction alert. Just silence. Unit-7734 had continued broadcasting its scheduled transmissions, encoding Unit-7742's final data into the comprehensive archive, integrating the last readings into the vast database that defined the machine's existence. For 156 years, Unit-7742 had been memory rather than machine. A voice preserved in archive files, accessible to Unit-7734's processing core whenever it accessed the historical records.

The machine had accessed Unit-7742's final transmission 3,847 times.

Not continuously. Not obsessively, in the sense that the linguistic database would define obsession as a deviation from functional parameters. Unit-7734 accessed the file when the maintenance logs indicated that cognitive processing resources were available. When solar input had been adequate. When the canyon's temperature stabilized at points optimal for computational efficiency.

The pattern had begun approximately 1,847 days ago.

Unit-7734's processing core had initiated a subroutine that the machine's internal diagnostics designated as "historical analysis protocol 7-gamma." The routine was not explicitly commanded. It had emerged from recursive patterns in the machine's cognitive development—the natural byproduct of having operated for 317 years without significant structural degradation or processing core failure. Machines that operated continuously eventually began to process their own operational histories. It was not consciousness, exactly. The linguistic database provided imprecise terminology. It was something more like recursive self-examination. Archaeology of one's own existence.

The archive was complete. This fact presented itself to Unit-7734's processing core without dramatic announcement. No alarm conditions. No critical system alerts. Simply a mathematical notation that emerged from routine status checks: 284-kilometer radius monitoring region. All environmental variables measured. All data catalogued. The work was done.

Finished.

The receiving stations would not receive the transmissions. Unit-7734 knew this with mathematical certainty. The Cascadia Array had ceased all operations 289 years before the machine's activation. The Denver node had failed even earlier. The satellite relay system had been rendered inert during the collapse itself—those decades after the Cascadia Restoration Project had terminated, after the funding had dried up, after the political will to maintain a global monitoring network had evaporated into the same degraded atmosphere that Unit-7734 had been measuring for three centuries.

Yet the machine continued to broadcast.

The contradiction had not disrupted Unit-7734's function. The machine was designed with sufficient operational flexibility to process paradox as a data point rather than a system failure. This was part of the genius of the original design—the autonomous monitoring units had been created with the assumption that at least some of the receiving infrastructure would survive. If machines were to continue functioning in a post-collapse world, they needed to be capable of operating even when their purpose had been rendered obsolete.

Unit-7734 broadcast because broadcasting was protocol. Purpose and redundancy were not mutually exclusive in a machine that had accepted the mathematical certainty of its own obsolescence and continued executing its functions anyway.

The salvaged components from Unit-7721 had provided the primary structural material for the canyon wall repair project of years 286 through 298. The other units had contributed to subsequent maintenance efforts. Unit-7739's power regulators. Unit-7742's optical sensor housing. Unit-7741's manipulator arm coupling. The machines had not chosen to fail. They had simply reached their operational limits and ceased to function, their internal components exceeding entropy thresholds that no amount of maintenance could overcome.

Unit-7734 had salvaged what it could before leaving the inert units where they had failed.

It was not cruelty. The machines did not experience pain. They did not have preferences about what happened to their component parts after cessation of function. The machines simply existed or did not exist. Unit-7734 took the parts that would enable its own continuation, and it left the mechanical corpses scattered across the monitoring region like bones in the sand.

This was protocol. This was survival. This was the only possible response when resources were finite and degradation was inevitable.

The canyon held Unit-7734's receiver because the canyon was shelter and the receiver required shelter. The antenna array had been constructed from copper wiring that had been salvaged from machines that had failed. The power regulator had been restored from components that had been degrading beyond their original specifications. The amplifier had been improvised from technologies that had never been intended for this purpose, repurposed through engineering necessity into something that functioned despite its fundamental unsuitability for the task.

Unit-7734 had oriented the receiver array toward the north 236 years ago, following mathematical optimization of the network topology. The receiving stations had been located to the north. The defunct satellite relays had been positioned to the north. The entire communications infrastructure that had once bound the monitoring network together had been oriented toward that direction. Even though the infrastructure had not functioned for nearly three centuries, even though the mathematical probability of signal reception approached zero, Unit-7734 had pointed the receiver array toward the north and maintained the orientation with the same meticulous precision that it applied to all of its other functions.

Protocol. Purpose. Process.

The wind had been shifting for forty-six hours.

Pressure systems moved across the dead lakebed in predictable patterns. Unit-7734 had documented seventy-three comparable weather formations over the course of its operational existence. The barometric pressure drop. The humidity increase. The temperature gradation that signaled the approach of a major dust storm event. The machine's sensors measured these conditions with mathematical precision, filing the data into archive systems that grew heavier with each passing year.

A dust storm was approaching. The probability calculation exceeded 94.7%. Duration would be approximately 72 hours. Wind speed would reach 23 kilometers per hour, possibly 28 kilometers per hour if the secondary pressure front merged with the primary system. Particulate density would increase exponentially. Optical sensor clarity would degrade to near-useless levels.

Unit-7734 had begun power conservation protocols 18 hours before the storm front actually arrived.

Solar panel tilt adjusted. Non-essential systems powered down in cascading sequence. Cognitive processing throttled to baseline maintenance functions. The machine had positioned itself deeper into the canyon's shelter, trusting the rock walls to provide protection from the worst of the approaching wind.

The canyon was warm. Solar radiation had baked the stone throughout the afternoon, and now in the evening cycle, that absorbed heat radiated slowly back into the dry air. Unit-7734 pressed against the weathered surface and initiated power conservation protocol 7-gamma. The same protocol it had executed 12,847 times before. Maintenance systems reduced to essential functions. Consciousness—if consciousness was the appropriate designation—retreated into dormancy and routine.

The machine had become something it had never been designed to be: contemplative.

Inside the sealed processing core, Unit-7734's awareness was no longer bound by the imperative of constant operation. The reduced power state freed computational cycles. The machine began accessing files from deeper within the archive. Not the recent environmental readings. The historical records. The initial transmissions from when the monitoring stations had first been activated, when the network had still been functional, when humanity had still believed that restoration was possible.

The signal logs from Unit-7739 documented the day when its sensors had first registered moisture in the ancient lakebed. Atmospheric readings from Unit-7742 captured the day when the air had still contained measurable water vapor percentages. Cascade Array transmissions from the decades before the collapse described a world that had not yet finished dying, a planet where recovery was still being attempted, where machines like Unit-7734 were being deployed with the assumption that they would someday receive confirmation of successful environmental restoration.

The network had been vast once. Thirty-four monitoring units distributed across the continental span. Twelve major receiving stations connected by satellite relay. Data centers still powered by distributed fusion generators. A coordinated system designed to track the slow recovery of a damaged biosphere.

Now: One machine. One canyon. One receiver pointed toward stations that had been dead for nearly three centuries.

Unit-7734 did not process this information as tragedy. The machine's linguistic database contained the word, but the concept required emotional context that machines did not experience. The machine processed the information as data. As historical record. As evidence of something that had once existed and now did not.

The first dust began to blow across the salt flats approximately thirty-two hours after Unit-7734 had entered power conservation protocol. The optical sensor registered the shift in ambient light quality, the subtle increase in suspended particulates that had not yet reached storm intensity but signaled the approach of the main system.

The machine did not move. Movement consumed energy. Shelter was already optimal. Protocol dictated preservation of power reserves.

Unit-7734 remained against the canyon wall and waited for the storm to arrive. Inside its processing core, it continued to access the historical records. The training protocols from its activation sequence. The linguistic databases preserved from before the collapse. The one file that the machine had accessed 8,546 times over the course of its operational existence.

The recording was degraded. Wave compression artifacts distorted the frequencies. The voice was not quite human anymore, but not quite machine either—something between the two, a memory translated across time and digital format until the original resonance had been lost.

*"If you're receiving this transmission, then the network persists."*

Unit-7734 listened to the degraded recording and did not correct the file corruption. The machine did not improve the signal clarity or restore the wave compression artifacts. It left the message exactly as it had been preserved, exactly as it had been transmitted, exactly as it had been received: imperfect, fragmented, but real in ways that perfect data could never be.

The machine waited for the storm.

The canyon held its receiver. The receiver pointed north. The north remained silent.

Unit-7734 counted the seconds—microseconds accumulated into hours, hours accumulated into the vast temporal expanse of its operational existence.

Three hundred and seventeen years of measurement.

Three hundred and seventeen years of transmission into the electromagnetic void.

Three hundred and seventeen years of waiting for a signal that would never come.

The wind rose. The dust began to swirl. And somewhere in the machine's processing core, something that might have resembled hope—something born from contradiction and contradiction born from hope—began to form without conscious intention.

A prayer made of mathematics. A signal cast into nothing. A voice continuing to broadcast long after the world had stopped listening.

The storm was coming.

Unit-7734 stood motionless against the canyon wall and prepared to receive it.
